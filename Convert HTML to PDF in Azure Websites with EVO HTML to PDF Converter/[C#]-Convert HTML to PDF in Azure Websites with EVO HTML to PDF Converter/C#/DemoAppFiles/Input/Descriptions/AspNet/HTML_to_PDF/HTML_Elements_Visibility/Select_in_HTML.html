<b>EVO HTML to PDF Converter</b> allows you select directly in HTML the elements to exclude from rendering to PDF by setting the <i><b>data-exclude</b></i> attribute on HTML elements you want to exclude. 
    The converter does not reflow the HTML content when you exclude an element from rendering and the place where the element would be normally rendered remains blank. 
    If you want to reflow the HTML content when the HTML element is hidden, you have to set <i>display:none</i> style for HTML element, eventually creating two separate stylesheets for screen and for print.

At the top of the demo you can choose the HTML document to convert which can be:
    <br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>HTML Page to Convert URL</b>. The URL must be accessible from the computer where the converter runs. If the page requires authentication or if you are using a proxy server to access Internet
            then you have to set the converter properties accordingly as described in documentation
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>HTML String with Exclude Attributes</b>. When you convert a HTML string you also have the option to specify a base URL that will be used
            by converter to resolve the relative URLs found in the HTML string to fully qualified URLs. If your HTML string uses only fully qualified URLs then this parameter is not necessary
    </li>
</ul>
